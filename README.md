 - What are important Java EE Design Patterns? https://github.com/in28minutes/Java-EE-Design-Patterns
- Some Creational patterns Examples
- Factory method
 - java.util.Calendar#getInstance() & java.nio.charset.Charset#forName()
- Prototype
 - java.lang.Object#clone()
- Singleton
 - java.lang.Runtime#getRuntime() & java.lang.System#getSecurityManager()
- Some Structural patterns
- Adapter
 - java.util.Arrays#asList() & javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlAdapter#marshal() and #unmarshal()
- Decorator
 - All subclasses of java.io.InputStream, OutputStream etc. & java.util.Collections : synchronizedXXX() and unmodifiableXXX() methods.
- Flyweight
 - java.lang.Integer#valueOf(int) (also on other Wrapper classes)
- Behavioral patterns
- Chain of responsibility
 - javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter() & Exception Handling
- Command
 - java.lang.Runnable
- Iterator
 - All implementations of java.util.Iterator
- Strategy (recognizeable by behavioral methods in an abstract/interface type which invokes a method in an implementation of a different abstract/interface type which has been passed-in as method argument into the strategy implementation)
 - java.util.Comparator#compare(), executed by among others Collections#sort().
- Template method (recognizeable by behavioral methods which already have a "default" behaviour definied by an abstract type)
 - All non-abstract methods of java.util.AbstractList, java.util.AbstractSet and java.util.AbstractMap.
